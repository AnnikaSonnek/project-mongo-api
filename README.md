# Project Mongo API

✓ Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!

✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).

✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).

✓ Your API should make use of Mongoose models to model your data and use these models to fetch data from the database.

✓ Your API should be RESTful.

## The problem
I had a lot of trouble thit starting up the project. I eventually changed the mong url from this mongodb://localhost/project-mongo to this: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/project-mongo and this made be be able to start the server. 

I started with creating the schema and model from my books-data. After that I created the basic routes but instead of using array methos I used the mongooes methods. It was a little hard understanding what the model actually is but eventually I got it. 

I followed Daniels instructions when creating the routs but took my time to write comments to make sure that I understood everything.
